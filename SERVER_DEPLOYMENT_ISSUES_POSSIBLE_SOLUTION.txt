Temporary solutions include:
- To zip up the files and upload directly upon each feature change - although this was cumbersome and not very effective.
- Downgrade tooling and test for Laravel 8 (which supports both >=PHP 7 & 8) on the server (Still in progress)
- Reach out to the hosting vendor and lodge a complaint for: 
* the http:// version sometimes loading instead of https:// to assure for security
* ask some questions as regards their git system to assure for quick server code push and deployment
