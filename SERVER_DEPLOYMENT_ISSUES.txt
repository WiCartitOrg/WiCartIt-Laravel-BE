The Cpanel Shared Server which is deployable with only PHP MYSQL Database has certain issues:
- Its version control system is having certain issues which made it difficult to use 
CI/CD features with the git system directly 

- The official support is for PHP-7.4; although the support was bumped up to version 8.0.1, 
the tool being used(Laravel 9) requires version 8.0.2(or greater); hence their are discrepancies in the code execution...

- For example - the migrations artisan commands were not working accordingly, all the database tables could not be created successfully on initialization, 
hence error in execution of the APIs.


- Server sometimes bring the http version of the website(http://) instead of (https://)...this is very dangerous and could expose the app to attacks.
